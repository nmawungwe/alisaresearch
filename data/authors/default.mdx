Welcome to Intern Memos, fellow interns! I’m Nyasha Mawungwe, an intern who likes building stuff.

I like tech, especially AI. I’m convinced AI is going to shake up education, health, and productivity in a big way, and I’m excited to be along for the ride. I also follow the crypto space. I think crypto is going to make a big impact on how we handle digital sovereignty and cross border payments.

When I’m not building, you can find me outdoors. Hiking and running are my go-to activities for staying active and enjoying nature.

Here on the site, I’ll be sharing blog posts about these interests and more. I’m looking forward to connecting with you and having some great discussions.

Thanks for stopping by internmemos!
